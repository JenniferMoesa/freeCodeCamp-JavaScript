DECLARE JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES
We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.
Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
