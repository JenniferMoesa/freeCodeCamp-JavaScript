DECLARE JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES
We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.
Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.


STORING VALUES WITH THE ASSIGNMENT OPERATORPASSED
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.





ASSIGNMENT WITH A RETURNED VALUE
Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.

var processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

processed = processArg(7);

//processed has a value of 2
