DECLARE JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES
We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.
Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.


ASSIGNMENT WITH A RETURNED VALUE
Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.

var processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

processed = processArg(7);

//processed has a value of 2
